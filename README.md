Welcome to **DynamicXRayCT**! This repository, complete with MATLAB code, is the backbone of our project: [Single-shot Tomography of Discrete Dynamic Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05269). Dive into our innovative method transforming high-resolution temporal imaging in dynamic tomographic fields.

## 🚀 Dynamic Tomographic Reconstruction

Facing the intricate task of capturing ever-changing discrete objects in dynamic tomography? **DynamicXRayCT** is your solution. By merging spatial and temporal insights of dynamic objects, we employ the level-set method for precision segmentation and a sinusoidal basis for dynamic motion. This blend leads to a computationally simple and easily fine-tuned variational framework, enabling 2D or 3D image sequencing with a single projections per frame.

## 🌈 Key Features

- **Temporal Image Reconstruction**: Achieve high-resolution imaging with limited measurements.
- **Level-Set Image Segmentation**: Precision segmentation for smoothly evolving objects.
- **Sinusoidal Motion Capture**: Masterful depiction of object dynamics.
- **Optimized Variational Framework**: Good computational efficiency and simplicity in optimization.
- **Xray Dataset Compatibility**: Proven excellence with synthetic and real X-ray data.
